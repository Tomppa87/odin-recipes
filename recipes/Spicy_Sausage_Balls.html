    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These sausage balls are as good as BisquickÂ® sausage balls, but without the carbs and gluten. They are also keto friendly! Eat them fresh out of the oven or refrigerate or freeze for later use.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>spicy pork sausage</li>
        <li>sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>almond flour</li>
        <li>coconut flour</li>
        <li>unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized balls (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.</li>
